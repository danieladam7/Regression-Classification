# Regression-Classification
of an abstract dataset with Optuna hyperparameter tuning 

1) Preliminary analysis (data visualization and printing)
2) Preprocessing (NaN samples replacing and standard scaling)
3) Metrics selection (MSE, MAE and R2-scoring, k-fold cross validation)
4) Model training and evaluation (Linear Regression, GB and XGB Regression, SVR)
5) Hyperparameter tuning and best model selection (optuna)
6) Evaluation on test data
